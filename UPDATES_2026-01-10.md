# Project Updates - January 10, 2026

## 1. Theme & Color Balance (Aesthetic Polish)
- **Contrast Balancing**: Addressed the issue where the background was "too dark" and content "too bright".
  - Balanced the global color scheme to reduce harsh contrast.
  - Softened text colors and adjusted background tones for a more premium look.
- **Texture Subtlety**: Refined gradients and background textures across sections to be more subtle and less distracting, focusing on depth rather than intensity.

## 2. Feature: 3D Spline Component (Hero Section)
- **3D Integration**: Added a `<spline-viewer>` component to the Hero Section.
- **Model**: Integrated a custom Spline scene (`https://prod.spline.design/stjq3Ba2j026E0q3/scene.splinecode`).
- **Styling**:
  - Scaled the model (`1.7x`) for impact.
  - Implemented a custom script to automatically hide the default Spline logo and badge for a cleaner, whitelabeled appearance.
- **Layout**: Reorganized the Hero section to a 2-column layout (Desktop) with the 3D model on the left and text on the right.

## 3. Feature: Luminous Card (About Section)
- **New Component**: Replaced static image with a custom 3D lighting "Luminous Card".
- **Design**:
  - Implemented a **Black Gradient** background (`#2a2a2a` to Black).
  - Added a **Custom "W" Logo** SVG with the project's primary Orange Gradient.
  - Added subtle edge glow and drop-shadow effects.
- **Interactivity**: Added specialized hover effects with shape morphing (`--ax` and `--offset` interpolation).
- **Content**: Updated text to "Fullstack Architecture" and "Building Scalable Systems".

## 4. Branding & Navigation
- **Logo Update**: Changed the "Yash" text in the navbar to use the **Sacramento** cursive font.
- **Styling**: Increased font size to `text-4xl` for a signature-like appearance.

## 5. Footer Improvements
- **Layout**: Expanded the footer container to **100% width**.
- **Margins**: Reduced side margins so the glass panel touches the screen boundaries (edge-to-edge look).

## 6. Contact Section
- **Button Animation**: Added a **Sliding Fill Effect** to the "Send Me A Message" button.
  - **State**: transitions from Black → Orange on hover.
  - **Contrast**: Text changes from White → Black.

## 7. Skills Section
- **Bug Fix**: Reverted the "Rapid Orange Tint" hover effect on skill cards to prevent flickering and "disappearing" issues. The cards now retain their smooth 3D rotation without background color shifts.

## 8. Layout Adjustments
- **About Section Line**: Moved the decorative SVG line to the main container.
- **Positioning**: Anchored the line exactly to the **Top-Right** corner of the section.
- **Status**: The line animation is currently **disabled** (commented out) per request.
